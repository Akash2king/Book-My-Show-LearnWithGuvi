# BookMyShow Clone - LearnWithGUVI Season 2

This project is a clone of the **BookMyShow** website, developed during **Day 1** of the LearnWithGUVI Season 2 series. The website features a simple and responsive design built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap 5**. It allows users to explore movie details, showtimes, and even book tickets for their favorite shows.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is part of my learning journey with GUVI's **LearnWithGUVI Season 2** on YouTube. The goal of this project was to implement a responsive movie booking page with essential UI components such as:

- A **navbar** with navigation links.
- **Movie details** section with title, director, genre, and description.
- A **book tickets** section with date, showtime, and seat availability.
